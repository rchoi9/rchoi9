- 👋 Hi, I’m @rchoi9 aka Rebecca!
- 👀 I’m interested in Cats, Games, and Freshwater Aquariums.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analytics at Fullstack! Clean data makes my day, messy data tickles my OCD.
- 📑 I'm currently working on my Data Analytics Capstone project! It is an analysis of 3 years worth of cafe transactions.
